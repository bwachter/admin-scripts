Introduction
------------

This is a cleaned up version of some useful scripts I've been carrying
in the git repository containing the configuration files I want to have
available on multiple computers.

License of all scripts -- unless stated otherwise -- is GPLv2.

All scripts are runable directly from the checkout directory, though some
may need configuration files in place to work properly. Examples of those
files can be found in the conf subdirectory.

To make the scripts available in the path for all users chdir to the git
directory, and run ./add-to-profile. This will create a file in profile.d
with the correct path. Re-run this script if you change the location of
the git checkout.
